## Entry Points for Contributors

### Story Entry Points

- Write a 'confession' from the perspective of a mundane object in Tomás's room (the broken fan, the hollow table leg, the chipped plate). What has it witnessed?
- Create a new chapter where Sebastián interviews another resident of the barrio—the baker, the laundress, a local militiaman. How does their 'river' differ from Tomás's?
- Write a scene from Sebastián Mora's past that explains why he became a 'thief of stories.' What confession is *he* avoiding?
- Imagine the novel Tomás and Sebastián are co-creating. Write a passage of 'magical realism' that grotesquely exaggerates a true, gritty detail from Tomás's life.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'confession booth' web experience where users can anonymously submit short, sensory memories (a smell, a sound, a texture) to build a collective 'river' of a place.
- Create a data visualization that maps the economic transactions in the novel: the pesos, the mangoes, the medicine, the stolen ledger. Represent the flow of value and its human cost.
